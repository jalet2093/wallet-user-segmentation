# Customer Segmentation and Propensity Model

## 🧠 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior, segmenting them into meaningful groups, and predicting the likelihood of purchasing or using a product.  
The goal is to help financial institutions identify top customers and improve marketing strategies using data-driven insights.

---

## 📊 Data
The project uses several datasets:
- **clients.xlsx** – Customer demographic and profile data.  
- **txs.xlsx** – Transactional information.  
- **segmentacion_group.xlsx** – Results from the clustering process.  
- **base_campaña.xlsx** – Campaign data for predictive modeling.

---

## ⚙️ Methods and Techniques
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation** – Handling missing values and feature engineering.  
- **Segmentation** – K-Medoids clustering to group customers by behavior.  
- **Prediction Model** – XGBoost for classification and scoring.  
- **Model Interpretation** – SHAP values to explain model predictions.

---

## 📈 Results
- Identified key customer groups with distinct purchasing behaviors.  
- Built a model to predict campaign response with high accuracy.  
- Provided insights to improve targeting and reduce marketing costs.

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost, shap)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Excel
- Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the project.  
2. Open the Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) file.  
3. Ensure all datasets are in the same folder.  
4. Run the notebook cells in order.
